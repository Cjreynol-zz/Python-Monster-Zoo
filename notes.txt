Monster Zoo

Visualizer -> Monster -> Manager

Manager holds a Monster, which holds a Visualizer.
Currently the Manager is locked into the visual.  To be able load up multiple Managers I would need to separate 
the interface from the manager.

Manager
-would become a LabelFrame instead of an instance of Tk

Interface
-Would be a main window that has a button to create an instance of Name_Menu, then add the LabelFrame to the main window

interface
	has root window, keeps passing root reference along so when manager is created it can link to that.
	Name_Menu just stores and passes the reference.
