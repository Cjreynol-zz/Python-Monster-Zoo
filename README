Python Monster Zoo Version 1.0
Chad Reynolds (@cjreynol)

A python3 standard library implementation of the handheld virtual pet games, think Giga Pet or Tamagachi.

Controls are straighforward Tkinter Interfaces.
The monster ages faster when it is sad, hungry/bored, or sleepy/dirty.  When it is happy the monster does not age.
The goal is to keep your monster alive for as long as possible.
The game is currently imbalanced, and after a short while a monster will become irreversibly sad.
